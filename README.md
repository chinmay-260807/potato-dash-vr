# 🥔 Potato Dash VR - Interactive Design Blueprint

Welcome to the official technical and creative blueprint for **Potato Dash VR**, the world's premier "wobbly" VR racing experience. This repository contains an interactive web-based documentation platform built with React, Tailwind CSS, and D3.js to showcase the game's core systems.

## 🌟 Project Vision
**Potato Dash VR** is a chaotic, physics-driven multiplayer racing game designed for high-immersion VR headsets (Meta Quest, Valve Index, etc.). Players embody "Spud-atars"—semi-sentient potatoes with exaggerated physics profiles—competing in high-stakes kitchen environments.

The game prioritizes **Physics Comedy** and **VR Comfort**, ensuring that while the characters are flopping uncontrollably, the players remain comfortable and engaged.

## 🛠️ Interactive Modules

The blueprint application features several specialized sections:

### 1. **Potato Physics Lab (Interactive Sim)**
Built with **D3.js**, this module allows engineers and designers to test "Spud-Logic" in real-time. 
- **Bounciness & Gravity Controls**: Adjust sliders to see how they impact "Weeble-Wobble" recovery.
- **Collision Detection**: Visualization of floor and wall interactions using simplified sphere proxies.

### 2. **Technical Architecture**
Details the recommended stack for full production:
- **Game Engine**: Unity 2022.3 LTS with XR Interaction Toolkit (XRI).
- **Networking**: Photon Fusion for high-tickrate physics synchronization.
- **Platform**: Cross-platform support for Standalone (Quest) and PCVR.

### 3. **Immersive VR UI/UX**
A deep dive into spatial design patterns:
- **Diegetic Menus**: Floating, tactile interfaces that exist within the 3D world.
- **Comfort Systems**: Dynamic vignetting and static reference frames to prevent motion sickness.
- **Safe Zone Logic**: Positioning UI between 1m and 2m to avoid eye strain.

### 4. **Kitchen Hazards (Obstacle System)**
A modular library of interactive hazards including:
- **Frying Pan Traps**: High-knockback physics launchers.
- **Butter Slip Ramps**: Zero-friction surface modifiers.
- **Mashed Potato Pits**: Dynamic speed reduction zones.

## 💻 Tech Stack (Blueprint App)
The interactive documentation itself is a showcase of modern web engineering:
- **React**: Component-based UI architecture.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe data structures for game constants and roadmap items.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive, "potato-themed" aesthetic design.
- **D3.js**: Custom physics engine simulation for the web.

## 🚀 Development Roadmap
- **Q1 2024**: Core Physics Engine & Single Player Alpha (Completed)
- **Q2 2024**: Multiplayer Networking (8 Players) (In Progress)
- **Q3 2024**: Potato Customizer & Store Integration
- **Q4 2024**: Level Editor & Community Workshop
